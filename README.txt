JamList by Ian Gilmore - live at jam-list.appspot.com

This app is intended to allow people to keep a list of songs they want to perform at jams, along with lyrics and notes.

v2.0 allows users to register, login and then save, edit or delete songs with key/lyrics and notes.

Changes from v1.0:
- switched to using Bootstrap CSS
- added capability to shrink/enlarge lyric text
- improved handling of lyric input for displaying linebreaks, etc.
- general appearance improvements

Functionality to be added:
- https support
- password reset capability
- sorting song list based on title or key
- Google Glass support
- batch song list upload (csv format?)
- ability to add links to videos/performances of songs
- ability to share songs (may have copyright concerns)

Although this app is something I am creating for the use of myself and friends who regularly haul paper jam lists around to jams, it is also an experimental webapp to experiment with Google App Engine using WebApp2, Jinja2 and Python.
Code will remain very rough for foreseeable future.
